Feature: moderator create zip files

	As a moderator
	I would like to have a zip file that contains not only a single yaml file but also html contents in separate html files
	So that when I create/edit a new challenge, a new zip file is created with a yaml file and its corresponding html files in it.
	I want a system that allow users to download the zip file immediately once the challenge is created/edited
