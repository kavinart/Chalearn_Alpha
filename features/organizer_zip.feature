Feature: organizer create zip files

	As an organizer, I would like to have a simple data serialization format that contains all specification of a challenge including title, description, htmls, phrases, and tasks
	So that when I create/edit a new challenge, I can have a single data file that contains all information about the challenge. 
	I want all the information of the challenge in a single yaml file
