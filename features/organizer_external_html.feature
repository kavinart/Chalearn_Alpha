Feature: add external html ability

	As an organizer, I would like to create a new challenge by only providing an external link that overrides the typical implementation of a challenge
	So that when I create a challenge, I can have the ability to implement my challenge on an external site without completing all the information about the challenge again on the form
	I want to have the ability to input an external site instead of typing pure html into a text box
